# Notes for production:
# - Replace print statements with a structured logger (e.g., logging module).
# - Implement robust authentication and authorization for all sensitive operations.
# - sender_id should be derived from the server-side session/token, not taken from client input.
# - Database session management needs to be handled carefully, especially with async operations.
#   The ChatService instance is created with a session in chat_controller.py per event.
# - Error handling can be more sophisticated (e.g., custom exception classes, detailed error codes).
# - For `connected_users`, use a distributed cache like Redis for scalability across multiple service instances.
# - Consider message delivery acknowledgments from clients.I have completed the cleanup and refinement of `chat-microservice/app/services/chat_service.py`.

**Summary of changes made:**

1.  **Read the file content:**
    *   Accessed `chat-microservice/app/services/chat_service.py`.

2.  **Identify and Remove Commented-Out Code & Placeholders:**
    *   Removed large blocks of commented-out code that were examples of event registration (this is handled in `chat_controller.py`).
    *   Removed placeholder comments related to database session management examples.
    *   Removed placeholder comments like "For the purpose of this subtask, we'll simulate message creation" and "Dummy for now".
    *   Removed all `print()` statements intended for debugging; replaced with comments suggesting proper logging.

3.  **Review and Refine Existing Comments & Docstrings:**
    *   Added a class docstring for `ChatService`.
    *   Refined method docstrings for `__init__`, `handle_connect`, `handle_disconnect`, `join_room`, `leave_room`, `send_room_message`, and `send_direct_message` to clearly explain their purpose, arguments, and key behaviors.
    *   Kept relevant comments regarding `connected_users` (scalability note) and the need for server-side `sender_id` derivation.
    *   Simplified comments within `handle_connect` and `handle_disconnect` by removing extensive examples and focusing on their core (conceptual) purpose.

4.  **Address Asynchronous Calls to Synchronous Repository:**
    *   Imported `asyncio`.
    *   In `send_room_message`:
        *   Replaced the placeholder `saved_message` creation with an actual call to `self.chat_repository.create_message(message_data)`.
        *   Wrapped this call with `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` to correctly handle the synchronous repository method in an async context.
        *   Included a `try-except` block for error handling during the database operation, emitting a `message_error` back to the sender on failure.
    *   In `send_direct_message`:
        *   Applied the same changes as in `send_room_message`, using `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` for `self.chat_repository.create_message(message_data)`.
        *   Included a `try-except` block with error emission.
        *   Refined logic for sending to `receiver_sid` if found in `connected_users`, with a fallback or status message if the user is not connected.

5.  **Write the cleaned and updated content back to the file:**
    *   The file `chat-microservice/app/services/chat_service.py` was overwritten with the refined and functionally corrected code.

**Key improvements:**
*   The service now correctly handles calls to the synchronous repository from its asynchronous methods using `asyncio.to_thread`.
*   Placeholder logic for message creation has been replaced with actual (though still to be fully tested) database interaction.
*   Comments are more focused on the actual implementation rather than general examples.
*   The code is cleaner and more aligned with production considerations (e.g., explicit error handling for DB calls).

The file `chat-microservice/app/services/chat_service.py` is now significantly cleaner and more robust in its interaction with the data layer.
